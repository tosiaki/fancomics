<div class="explanation">
	<p>Originally this website was supposed to be purely about works that people have made themselves rather than reposting and translating things from Japanese, but figuring that there would otherwise be no way to get this site off the ground, it is now also a website for translations of content from Japanese. If you have translations of Japanese fancomics, feel free to post them here.</p>
	<p>In the long run though, it is hoped that this website can become one where people submit their own works.</p>
	<p>Original works can also be posted on this website by writing "Original" as the fandom.</p>
